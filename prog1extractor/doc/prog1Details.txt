Prog1 Description by Jarett Sofronski for CSCE 240

For this assignment, I created a program called WebFileReader which 
reads and writes 10k files from my 2 companies, Johnsons&Johnson and General Mills.
To achieve this, i made a file reader which takes an input file of the 10k data, 
counts the characters, words, and lines from the file, and prints an indented format
of the data to an output file for the specific company.
