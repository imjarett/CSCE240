Command 1: Risk Factors

Output for General Mills:
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.Business and Industry Risks The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we arenot able to compete effectively, our results ofoperations could be adverselyaffected. The human and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories aremanufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their productsthrough brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and otherresources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regionalbrands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories isbased on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity,convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our largecompetitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which couldadversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected.Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products inresponse to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustainbrand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic andprivate label products. We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition,large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing,increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increasedpromotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs,and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. Inaddition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2023, Walmart accounted for 21 percentof our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significantcustomers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging,and energy may adversely affect ourprofitability. The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such asweather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tradetariffs, pandemics, war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmentalagricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile. Commodityprice changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unable toincrease productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. Wedo not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work aswe intend. 
 9Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers toavoid certain products or ingredients. We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of ourproducts or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers frombuying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,which may result in decreased demand for ourproducts. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offerproducts that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption maychange from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify orreact to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on atimely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer.Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium,trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients orattributes. We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow ourbusiness faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolioby adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our abilityto increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new andexisting categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of ourbrands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value coulddiminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner,adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliverconsistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use ofsocial and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation andopinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriouslydamage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could benegatively impacted.Operating RisksIf we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as aresult of the highly competitive environment inwhich we operate. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our productsin highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce coststhrough productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect ourprofitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturingfacilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negativelyimpact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase ourefficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of theanticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business. Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or ourmanufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics,war, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair ourability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a singlesupplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capitalequipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and
   10external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact ouroperations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes withsignificant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to ourcustomers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequatesteps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularlywhen a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well asrequire additional resources to restore our supply chain. Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strainour supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks. In fiscal 2023, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to anumber of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: ●political and economic instability;●exchange controls and currency exchange rates;●tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;●nationalization or government control of operations;●compliance with anti-corruption regulations;●foreign tax treaties and policies; and●restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences. Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuationscould cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Britishpound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enterinto agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not beeffective in significantly reducing our exposure. A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect ourreported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses.Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on informationtechnology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety ofbusiness processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructureare critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chainmanagement, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communicationamong our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information aboutour employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependenton services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such ascatastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computerviruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the securityand viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored onthose systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result intransaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales andcustomers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impactsthat may have a material adverse effect on our business.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our successdepends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions,our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss ofkey employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated withentering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies,and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.
 11Legal and Regulatory RisksIf our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we mightneed to recall those items and may experienceproduct liability claims ifconsumers or their pets are injured. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall couldresult in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability ofproduct for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant productrecall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence inour products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, theFederal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreigngovernmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products andthe health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits,administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products andcould be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations.We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audienceto whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increaseour cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply withenvironmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party toa variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk ofunidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, andcompliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance withenvironmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact onglobal temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate changehas a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commoditiesthat are necessary for our products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities,disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs. Increasing concernover climate change or other sustainability issues also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumerpreferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues. We may also become subject toadditional legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change or other sustainability issues, including greenhouse gasemission regulations (e.g., carbon taxes), energy policies, sustainability initiatives (e.g., single-use plastic limits), and disclosureobligations. If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures thatwe are currently undertaking to reduce our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if we choseto take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations.We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progresstoward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, then the resulting negative publicity could harm ourreputation and adversely affect demand for our products.Financial and Economic RisksVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may causevolatility in our gross margins and net earnings. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, andcorn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded inearnings currently, which may result in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost ofsales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until weutilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating
   12profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accountingtreatments.Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products. The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economicuncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchasesaltogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix tolower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our pricessufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers thatpurchase products from our North America Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adverselyaffect our ability to pay dividends. As of May 28, 2023, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $12.0 billion. The agreements under which we have issuedindebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limitour: ●ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly ifthe ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and●flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in generaleconomic conditions. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to complywith any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to itsstated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financialperformance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond ourcontrol.We depend on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Our financial performance, ourcredit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, and the liquidity of the overall global capitalmarkets could affect our access to, and the availability, terms and conditions, and cost of capital. Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefitpension,other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, includingdefined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pensionplans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interestrates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect thefunded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of theplans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results ofoperations and cash flows from operations. A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost ofcapital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidatedresults of operations and net worth. As of May 28, 2023, we had $21. 2 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting unitsis tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Wecompare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of thereporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fairvalue are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from ourlong-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and otherfactors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomicconditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. While we currently believe that our goodwillis not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.
 13 We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with theBlue Buffalo,Pillsbury,Totino’s,Old El Paso, Progresso,Annie’s,Nudges,andHäagen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects ofobsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances,legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), thelevel of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow modelusing inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not ownthe brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors andmacroeconomic conditions were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired.OurProgresso,EPIC, andUncle Toby’s brands had risk of decreasing coverage and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 ofthis report.

Output for Johnson & Johnson:
An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations

The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development.

For the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.

Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.

The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.

Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the
8
 

Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.

Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.

The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.

Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such incident(s), a health crisis or health crises), including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The continued spread of COVID-19 or other health crises may cause the Company to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.

While the U.S. and other countries have substantially reopened their economies, the extent to which COVID-19, or other health crises, could impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of an outbreak and impact of variants. A surge in COVID-19 or other health crises could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of disease. The global spread of COVID-19 or other health crises could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.

We also face uncertainties related to our vaccine development programs, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that continued evolution and mutation of disease and the duration of a particular outbreak may impede our ability to conduct trials within a specified time frame; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers, external manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we engage; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings

Global sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.
9
 

Sales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny or pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially impose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to penalties. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.

The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.

Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.
Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent adoption by the EU, enactment by South Korea and the anticipated enactment
10
 

by additional countries of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.

See Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property

The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.

Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.

The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.

In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization

Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years
11
 

accounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.

The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.

Risks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions

The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.

Foreign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.

Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.

Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws
12
 

and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.

Other Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:
•local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash;
•protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
•compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;
•diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
•potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;
•political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.

Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.

The Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provoked strong reactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and various other countries and economic and political organizations around the world. We have been monitoring the geopolitical situation in Russia since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War and have suspended additional investment, enrollment of clinical trials, and supply of our personal care products in Russia. We continue to monitor the need for humanitarian relief in the region and continue to supply our medicines, medical devices and equipment in the region in compliance with the applicable sanctions. We will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and to evaluate our activities and future operations in Russia.

Actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War include the imposition of export controls and broad financial and economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Russian government has already taken action allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, other risks related to the broad economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine War, including foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in countries affected by the Russia-Ukraine War and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers operating in Russia and Ukraine. We also continue to monitor the various sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine War.

The full impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the ongoing conflict, on the global economy and geopolitical relations, in general, and on our business in particular, remain uncertain. Any or all of the foregoing risks could
13
 

have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, particularly as the conflict continues for an indefinite period of time. Given that developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine War are ongoing and have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise that are not presently known to us. The Russia-Ukraine War may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

Risks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business

The planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.
In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a standalone publicly traded company, which was subsequently named Kenvue, Inc. ("Kenvue"). The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 2023. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances.

The costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business.
The Company has incurred, and is expected to incur, significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.

Following the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.
The Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.

The planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.
The Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among other things, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the IRS and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be based on, among other things, various facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and Kenvue regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to the planned separation the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.

Other Risks

Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of
14
 

knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs.

Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share.

An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation.
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.

As a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, there has been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its direction. Although we have taken steps to enhance our protections against these attacks, we may not be able to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, we are aware of incidents in which our third-party partners have been the target of information security or cybersecurity incidents as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War. Although, to date, our IT Systems have not been compromised by these incidents, it is possible that future information security or cybersecurity incidents involving our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could successfully compromise our IT Systems, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation.
The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities.
