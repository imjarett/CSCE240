CHANGES
This program improves functionality by utilizing bits of code from Jacob Walton's code. The adjustments are documented as follows:
- borrowed code format when checking for all commands to make sure a command can be recognized even if it doesnt begin with a dash or contain any dashes
- implemented the ability to switch between companies which Jacob's code has
